## About Us

RadioStack is hardware and semiconductor design company based in Manchester, NH. Being one of only a few organizations designing open source chips, we are at the forefront of emerging semiconductor technology. Our goal is to not only create amazing products, but to build the open source community in an area not accustomed to it. 

## Our first product, the Maverick-603
The Maverick-603 will be the first affordable FT8 receiver containing an RF receiver chip designed using only open source tools and manufactured in the U.S. Its low power consumption will increase versatility and decrease size for a device that can perform under almost any conditions. This all-in-one system will allow for operations to run locally, dramatically increasing security and improving usability. The Maverick-603 is the first RadioStack product of open software defined radio applications.  Future roadmap ideas include transmit and additional digital modes
