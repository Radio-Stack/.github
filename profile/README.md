## About Us

RadioStack is hardware and semiconductor design company based in Manchester, NH. Being one of only a few organizations designing open source chips, we are at the forefront of emerging semiconductor technology. Our goal is to not only create amazing products, but to build the open source community in an area not accustomed to it. 

Our first product, the Maverick-603, is turnkey RF receiver capable of reading and decoding FT8 signals between 7MHz and 70MHz. The Maverick will be available for purchase soon, so keep an eye out for updates.
