## About Us

RadioStack is hardware and semiconductor design company based in Manchester, NH. Being one of only a few organizations designing open source chips, we are at the forefront of emerging semiconductor technology. Our goal is to not only create amazing products, but to build the open source community in an area not accustomed to it. 

## Our first product, the Maverick-603
The Maverick-603 will be the first affordable FT8 receiver containing an RF receiver chip designed using only open source tools and manufactured in the U.S. Its low power consumption will increase versatility and decrease size for a device that can perform under almost any conditions. This all-in-one system will allow for operations to run locally, dramatically increasing security and improving usability. The Maverick-603 is the first RadioStack product of open software defined radio applications.  Future roadmap ideas include transmit and additional digital modes

The Maverick-603 is an RF receiver capable of acquiring FT8 signals between 7MHz and 70MHz. FT8 is an amateur radio digital-mode protocol that can be decoded at low signal-strengths and has an extremely long range. If hardware that can decode FT8 frequencies is used, the setup to receive FT8 is simple. As opposed to other digital modes, FT8 antennas are easy to set up and FT8 can still be received and decoded even when there is a lot of ambient noise. It is useful for military, government, and popular among hobbyists but with the current hardware on the market, setup is difficult and requires a large amount of external hardware and software. Our design, however, removes the need for much of these external components.

Our target frequencies (7-70 MHz) were chosen because the most popular FT8 bands fall within this. With this frequency range, we will be able to receive signals from around the world with high accuracy.
